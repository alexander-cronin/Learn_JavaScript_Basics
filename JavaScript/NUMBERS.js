// Numbers:
// JavaScript uses "numbers", rather than 'float', or 'int'
// Javascript is a more 'loosely typed' language in comparison to C based languages

let number = 10;
let otherNumber = 200.00986;
console.log(number);
console.log(otherNumber);
// Float and int are the same type in JavaScript, therefore can be used interchangibly.
let doSomeStrangemath = number + otherNumber * 3 - 10 * 0.1;
console.log(number + " + " + otherNumber + " + " + 3 + " - " + 10 + " * " + 0.1 + " = " + doSomeStrangemath);

// Fractions will be converted into decimal form
// Example:
let fraction = 7 / 8;
let threeQuarters = 3 / 4;
let oneThreeQuarthers = 1 + 3 / 4;
let improperFraction = 15 / 10;
let improperFraction2 = 5 / 4;

console.log(fraction);
console.log(threeQuarters);
console.log(oneThreeQuarthers);
console.log(improperFraction);
console.log(improperFraction2);

// Negetive Numbers:
// Example:
let negetiveNumber = -45;
console.log(negetiveNumber);

// Subtracting a greater number, from a smaller number will result in a negetive number as well
let inTheRed = 10000 - 30000;
console.log(inTheRed);
